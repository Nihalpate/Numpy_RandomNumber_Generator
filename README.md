# Random Number 
[This is not a project, but series of python code which will generate random number using different distribution]

(1) why we need random number anyway?
- Usually, we need Random Number to replicate different random event like, customer arrival, service time and others. We need to replicate all of those events because we need to perform Monte Carlo Simulation for tasting different adjustments in the model to solve different problems.
