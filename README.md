# Random Number 
[This is not a project, but series of python code which will generate random number using different distribution]

(1) why we need random number anyway?
- Usually, we need Random Number to replicate different random events like, customer arrival, service time, and others. We need to replicate all of those events because we need to perform Monte Carlo Simulation for tasting different adjustments in the model to solve different problems. 

(2) Why Histogram?
- Histogram is the most intuitive way of predicting the proper distribution of the given data. This way you just have to match the shape of the histogram with the conventional histograms of the popular distributions, which ever shape is most suitable, will be the distribution of the data that we have.
